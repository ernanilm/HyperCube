# Summary

***UPDATE***  20181027 ***UPDATE*** 

20181027: Updated the diffuser duct and created several versions that are for a volcano heatblock. Also, a Zesty Nimble mount for the Orion sensor is uploaded. Finally, the Orion heatsink mount was re-designed to provide a more secure clamp for the groove mount.

20180926: Designed a PP Orion heatsink mount to eventually be used for the Zesty Nimble mount that is in progress. This mount allows for access to the hotend w/o removing the Orion sensor.

20180926: Developed a mount for the Precision Piezo Orion sensor. The heatsink mount was redesigned to remove the original design's requirements to use brass inserts, while maintaining the interchangeability (same footprint) of the original Orion heatsink mount from Precision Piezo. I also designed a fan duct for the E3D heatsink that accommodates a quiet 40 mm fan. This mount is compatible with the other parts previous developed, just download what you need for your printer.


This hotend assembly has mounts for three different mounting schemes for either a clone or genuine E3D hotend. 

1. Typical hotend mount w/ no bed leveling options
2. Precision Piezo mounts (Piezo20 and Orion sensor)
3. Zesty Nimble (Original and Sidewinder) w/ Piezo20 sensor

There is now an X Carriage to handle 19mm, 16mm, and 15 mm bearing diameters with NO BRASS INSERTS.
.
Detailed Mounting Schemes

1. Typical hotend w/ only BLTouch or Induction sensor
2. Typical hotend w/ Zesty Nimble Mount
3. Precision Piezo (Piezo20) sensor 
4. Zesty Nimble w/ Precision Piezo20 sensor
5. Zesty Nimble Sidewinder w/ Precision Piezo20 sensor
6. Precision Piezo Orion sensor
7. Several X Carriage options (19 mm, 16 mm, and 15 mm) -- updating soon w/ side set screws (see Orion images) to help with holding the IGUS bearings in place.

# Print Settings

Printer: P3Steel, Hypercube Evolution
Resolution: 0.20
Infill: 40

Notes: 
Use your own judgement on the resolution. I printed most of these parts in 0.24 w/ PETG; however, the Precision Piezo20 heatsink mount was printed in 0.15. If you typically print in the default 0.2, that is sufficient as well.

Supports are not required for most of the prints. The extruder mount typically needs supports for the MPX connectors, endstop bolt holes, and the Zesty Mount. 

# How I Designed This

## Compact and simple hotend mount for the Hypercube Evolution

My design goals were to give an option to use the original x-carriage mount designed by SCOTT_3D with the choice to use the modified version. I incorporated several options to use either an inductive probe (12mm), or BLTouch. There are two Precision Piezo designs which utilize the Piezo20 and Orion sensors. The Zesty Nimble extruders were also incorporated into the Piezo20, but I have not finished it or the Orion sensor. I don't use mesh leveling, so if there are issues with these designs, please let me know. The fan mount and duct was inspired by jcen517.

I included 2 options for electrical connections on the hotend mount based on how many wires are required for your setup. The connectors used are MPX. The hotend I use is a clone, so if it doesn't fit well, I can make the modifications.

Lastly, I designed a duct which wraps around the hotend and maintains a fairly even pressure at the outlets. There are three outlets at the bottom. The idea behind the flow was to give each side 40% and the center 20% by using ribs in the duct which divide the airflow initially entering the horizontal portion of the duct. I also added a rib in the center since initially the flow was skewed to one side of the duct for the center outlet.

# Detailed Updates

## Updates in descending chronological order

20180926: Designed a PP Orion heatsink mount to eventually be used for the Zesty Nimble mount that is in progress. This mount allows for access to the hotend w/o removing the Orion sensor.

20180924: Developed a mount for the Precision Piezo Orion sensor. The heatsink mount was redesigned to remove the original design's requirements to use brass inserts, while maintaining the interchangeability (same footprint) of the original Orion heatsink mount from Precision Piezo. I also designed a fan duct for the E3D heatsink that accommodates a quiet 40 mm fan. This mount is compatible with the other parts previous developed, just download what you need for your printer.

20180905: There were issues with the duct design touching the heatblock and thanks to VAEin3D who first brought this to my attention; I modified the duct. I went back to the CAD files and recently made adjustments to create a diffused pattern, yet I maintained the internal ribs that directs 20% of the flow through the middle three slots and the outer three on each side provides the remainder 40% each. 

20180425: Developed a mount for the Zesty Nimble Sidewinder which is designed to be used with the rest of the parts for the previously designed Nimble. I also elongated the hole spacing for the PP PCB as there were several people commenting that it did not fit. These are reflected in all the designs where the PCB is mounted in the front.

20180408: Developed a mount for the Zesty Nimble and corresponding clamp w/o the Precision Piezo sensor. I had to adjust some of dimensions to have the heatsink fit flush. Also, this mount requires no brass inserts.


20180313: Modified the X Carriage 2.1 to require NO BRASS INSERTS. There are two types uploaded. One is the 19 mm bearing version (X Carriage 2.1.1), 16 mm version (X Carriage 2.1.2), and 15 mm bearing version (X Carriage 2.1.3). Each of these new versions requires a different clamp (X Carriage Clamp 2.1.x). In addition, I also extended the x end stop flag by 2 mm from the original (X End Stop Flag 1.1). Both of the new x carriages will utilize the same ducts as the 2.1 version.


20180305: Designed an X Carriage to accommodate a 19 mm bearing. The original design was from AZSUN (2546995), but I redesigned it to be used with the other components I designed. There are two ducts that are extended in length to reach the fan mount since this carriage is slightly larger than the original. I have not printed and tested each of these; however, I did assemble them in Solidworks, which should be sufficient. If you have issues, let me know, and I can adjust the parts.


20180217: Designed a mount for the Zesty Nimble that incorporates the Precision Piezo sensor. This mount was designed with the help of Chris Branson who printed, evaluated, and provided feedback to improve the design.
 
The Precision Piezo files are updated to mount the Piezo20 PCB for the Piezo20 Module in the front of the extruder mount. There are also STL files to mount a Universal Piezo Z-Probe PCB for the Piezo20 Module on the left side as viewed from behind the extruder mount.

There is a STL Information Section added below that explains each STL in further detail and a PDF file in the files section for download.


20180128: Tested and modified the parts for the Precision Piezo (PP) sensor. 

The performance from generating 10 sets of bilinear grid mesh data achieved a calculated range (accuracy) of 0.0256 mm or 25.6 um and standard deviation of 0.0076 mm or 7.6 um. This test was most representative of results when executing a bed level prior to starting a print. Moreover, it is noteworthy to mention here that the kinematics of each machine will play a significant role in the grid mesh accuracy. The repeatability tests yielded a calculated range (accuracy) of 0.0036 mm or 3.6 um and standard deviation of 0.0013 mm or 1.3 um. Since this machine has a z-axis that is driven by a trapezoidal leadscrew and the probe is striking the same point, this test typically yields more favorable results. 

See the test results in the files section for more information. I also removed the previous STLs to remove confusion. If someone needs them, please let me know.

20171121: Updated the fan mounts due to the material being too thin in the corners. I made the adjustment just prior to initially uploading, then re-checked today and it was too thin, so made the modifications.


20171120: Precision Piezo mount with two extruder mount options for either an embedded bowden connector or the typical clones with a PC4-01 (Thread Diameter:9.729mm). If requested, I can remove the connector in the center if only two connectors are required. The clone or original E3D hotend heatsinks fit the PP Hotend Mount 1.0 design.
I printed the hotend mount in PETG, 0.15 layer height, 4 top and bottom layers, 3 walls, 0.4 mm hotend diameter, and 40% infill. The extruder mount was printed the same as above with 0.24 layer height.
I don't have the Precision Piezo kit yet to test, but I printed everything and it should work. If you have a sensor, and want to try it out before I receive mine, please let me know if there are any issues.


20171111: Added version of duct whereby two exit ports are pointed towards the nozzle.
