# Summary

Trying to put my entire Hypercube Evolution remix collection into one thing was getting cumbersome so I decided to split the project up into major assemblies. 

My previous collection of remixes can be found at [Thing:2856944](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2856944)

<P><B>XY Axis Remix Goals:</B><BR>
Utilize genuine Gates idler pulleys.  Quality control on these appears to be MUCH better than the generic idlers but they are about 1mm wider and only come in 5mm bore.<BR>
Minimize/Eliminate needing supports.<BR>
No brass inserts.</P>

<P>Feel free to leave any comments or suggestions.  If you use any of this please post a make and/or remix.  Step files provided for all files.</P>

<P><I>Please keep checking back for updates.  I've only been posting parts after I test fit on my printer but I've made many tweaks since posting.  <strike>I'll remove the "work in progress" tag once I get it to the point I feel will be a "final" version for my build.</strike> I've removed the "work in progress" tag so please check the change log below for any future updates.</I</P>


# Parts Notes

<P><B>Y Carriage</B><BR>
I'm using 30mm length, 5mm diameter rod stock for each of the two idler pulleys.   Use 10mm M3 button head screws to capture the rods in place.<BR>
All captured nut pockets are designed for square nuts.  The generic stainless 3mm nuts from Amazon are what I'm using.<BR>
Use 10mm M3 screws for the 8mm linear rod clamps.  I opted to remove the original clamp location due to it being a pain to get to once installed on the frame.<BR>
Prints without supports.<BR>
A version for 10mm diameter X linear rod supplied but I have not tested it.
</P>
<P><B>Y Carriage Bearing Cap</B><BR>
Uses 18-20mm M3 screws to attach to the Y carriage.
Utilizes M6 nuts and the M6 grub screws you didn't use in the frame angle brackets.  Cut your X linear rods such that they end flush with the back of the Y carriage.  If your X linear rods are the correct length you can use these M6 grub screws to tighten up against the ends of the rods and help prevent the belt tension from pulling on the Y carriage putting strain on the Y bearings.  I read a post on the Facebook group about this and liked the idea. The Prusa MK2 used to use a similar solution for their X axis rods.<BR>
Prints without supports.
</P>
<P><B>XY Idler</B><BR>
Utilizes 40mm length, 5mm diameter rod stock for the two idlers.  I printed a 5mm washer as a spacer.  A stainless 5mm washer has too large an outer diameter and will rub on the pulleys.  Use a 6-10mm M3 button head screw to capture the 40mm idler shaft in place.<BR>
Prints without supports.
</P>
<P><B>XY Stepper Mounts</B><BR>
Remixed from original Scott3D files but based on M3d_Factory remix.  A few minor tweaks but I really just needed to be able to make easy changes.<BR>
Prints without supports.
</P>
<P>
<B>X Carriage</B><BR>
I wanted to have more control over the tension placed on the X bearings so I modified the carriage to use bearing retaining plates.<BR>
Uses M3 square nuts and 10mm M3 screws to hold the X bearing caps.<BR>
Uses 10mm M3 screws to hold the Belt_Clamp.  Screws directly in to the X Carriage plastic.<BR>
Prints without supports.
</P>
<P>
<B>Y Endstop Bracket</B><BR>
I elected to utilize only minimum endstops for both X and Y.  I'm using these optical endstops from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0721X9VST/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Amazon</a>.  They are no longer available but the same style from another vendor is.  Use two 6mm M3 screws directly into the plastic to secure the sensor.<BR>
Prints without supports.
</P>
<P><B>General Notes:</B><BR>
The Aluminum rod stock I purchased from Amazon was slightly oversized so I chucked it up in a drill bit and sanded it until it was just under 5mm.
<BR><BR>
All of the 5mm brass rod stock I've purchased so far is already just under 5mm actual size.
<BR><BR>
I used Aluminum in the Y Carriage just to save a bit of weight.

# Change Log

4/7/2019 - To better fit with my rear stepper mount setup (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3548096) I modified the Y Endstop Mount.  The new version allows me to adjust for a little more Y axis travel.  The old version works fine if you don't need the extra adjustment.

4/5/2019 - Added all of the hardware (screws, nuts, 5mm rods, etc) to the models.  Check the step files for them.  While I was at it I made a few minor tweaks to hole clearances, etc.  Nothing game changing, I'm not reprinting any of the changes.

3/29/2019 - I removed the "Work in progress" tag from this thing.  Yesterday I assembled the printer to the point I could home the X and Y axis.  Since I haven't made any further changes in the past couple weeks and I saw no problems once it actually moved I think it's "done"...for now.  

3/16/2019 - Added some vertical float to the bottom X carriage bearing.  Files updated to v2 to try to avoid some confusion with earlier versions.  Test fitted on the printer and no detectable horizontal movement but the carriage seems to move just a bit better than with the rigid mounted lower bearing.

Also, revised XY_Idler_Mount due to mine cracking at the frame bolts.  Likely due to the material I'm using but still.  Plus, added chamfers, everything is better with chamfers.

On a request, did a quick remix for 8mm Y rods.  Files only contained in the XY_Axis_xDia8_yDia8_STL.zip file.  Only contains the changed files. *Warning* Completely untested.

3/14/2019 - Redesigned the X Carriage to use only three bearings.

3/12/2019 - Added the X Carriage

3/11/2019 - Added the Y end stop bracket STL and STEP files.
